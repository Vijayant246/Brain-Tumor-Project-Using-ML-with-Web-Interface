# Brain Tumor Prediction Using CNN and Transfer Learning (VGG19)

This project implements a deep learning-based approach to predict brain tumors using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transfer learning with the VGG19 model. It includes a web-based user interface for user-friendly interaction, allowing users to upload MRI images and obtain predictions regarding the presence of a tumor.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: 
  Utilizes a pre-trained VGG19 model for feature extraction and fine-tuning to enhance accuracy in brain tumor detection.

- **Web Interface**: 
  A user-friendly web application to upload MRI images and receive predictions in real-time.
